  ## App tour - Description of the App itself 
  
   The app is a simple calculator based on compound interest, 
   and will be used to calculate specific parameters for an investment plan.
  
The user has to fill in the input form, which contains the six variables:
1. Starting Amount - _How much money will be invested in the beginning of the investment._ 
2. Investment Length - _How many periods (years) the investment should last._
3. Compound - _How often the Contribution & Interest payments will take place each Period._
4. Interest Rate - _How much the value of the investment is expected to grow each period. The calculator will take compounds into account._   
5. Additional Contribution - _Apart from Interest Rate, How much additional money will be added to the investment each compound._
6. Contribution time - _When the Contributions should be payed each compound._

After clicking "Regn Ut" (Calculate) the user will recive an output which consists of:
1. Results summary - _A simple display of the totals; End Balance, Starting Amount, Total Contributions, Total Interest, Growth %._
2. Pie Chart - _Showing a Breakdown of the end-balance; how much is starting-amount, contributions & Interest._
3. Balance Growth Graph - _Showing the growth of timeline three elements; Principal, Interest, Balance._
4. Balance Sheet (Dataframe) - _A table showing the effects of all different factors though-out the investment lifespan._


Note: 
* _Starting Amount + additional contributions makes the principal amount._
* _Principal amount + Interest Rate makes the Balance._
